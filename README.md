# 👋 Hi, I'm Gonzalo

I'm a self-taught backend developer focused on Python. I'm building a solid foundation in software development while working on personal projects, improving my Git workflow, and applying to freelance opportunities and entry-level jobs.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python** (intermediate): scripting, OOP, modules, error handling, file I/O
- 📡 **Data & Automation**: web scraping, APIs, data parsing, email notifications
- 🧰 **Tools & Practices**: Git, GitHub, CLI, Markdown, virtual environments
- 🗃️ **Databases**: SQLite, basic SQL, storage and retrieval with Python
- 🛠️ **Under Study**: Django, MySQL, software design patterns, testing

## 🚀 Projects

I’m currently working on three main repositories:

- `scraping-bot`: a modular Python scraper with storage, logging, and email alerts
- `developer-roadmap`: a JSON-based study planner with CLI interaction
- `developer-profile`: a structured JSON-based profile for tailoring job applications

All projects follow clean directory structures, use virtual environments, and aim to be testable and maintainable.

## 🧠 What I’m learning

- Advanced Python concepts (decorators, context managers, async)
- Django fundamentals for real-world backend development
- Writing robust, scalable, and readable code
- Applying version control and documentation best practices

## 💬 Soft Skills

- 🧭 **Self-discipline**: I follow structured routines and study plans
- 🏗️ **Consistency**: I build small improvements every week
- 🎯 **Autonomy**: I can research, design, implement, and debug without external supervision
- 🔍 **Critical thinker**: I like understanding the “why” behind decisions
- 🔁 **Growth mindset**: I’m not afraid to start small and iterate fast

## 🌍 I’m looking for...

Opportunities to contribute to real-world Python projects — especially in:

- Back-end automation
- Data pipelines
- Scripting and scraping
- Entry-level developer roles
- Freelance gigs aligned with my current stack
